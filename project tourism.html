                    <h2>Legends behind the city</h2>
                    Many stories are stated as the reason behind the name of the city. It is stated that Goddess Durga of the great Kanakadura Temple killed the demon and relaxed in the city for some time and as she won the demon, this place has the term ‘Vijaya’ or victory in her name, while wada is the term that denotes place or location. This means that the meaning of the city’s name is ‘place of victory’. Indrakeeladri hill, in which the Kanakadurka temple is located is referred to be as the place in which Arjuna got the Pashupatastra from Lord Shiva as per the great epic Mahabaratha. Therefore, the city was called as Vijayavatika, which later changed as Vijayawada. This city is otherwise called as ‘Bezwada’ and it is believed that the reason behind this name is that River Krishna obliged Arjuna to make a path for her to merge into the Bay of Bengal. Based on the request, Arjuna made a Bejjam, which means hole through the mountains and the place was then begun to be called as Bejjamwada, which was later changed as Bezawada. The name of this city was found to have made a mention in the stone age relics found in the banks of River Krishna.
                     Early days of Vijayawada:
                    
                    It is found from the stone carvings in Vijayawada that besides being the folklore, this city was the seat of evolution for both Hinduism and Buddhism. Records stated that in 260 BC, King Asoka has conquered the Kalinga Empire to which this city was a part earlier. Again, in 208 AD, this area was ruled by a king called Chandra Sri Satakarni. Then, during the 5th and 6th Century, this region was the important center of Vishnukundin Rulers, during whose rule the Mogalarajapuram caves were known to have built.

                    The rule of Chalukyas in Vijayawada:
                    
                    During the rule of Badami Chalukyas, this region saw great developments and during this period (i.e.) during the 7th century AD, the Undavalli Caves were built. This city was acting as the headquarters during the rule of Eastern Chalukyas. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, this place again saw great improvements. During the 639 AD, the Chinese traveller, Xuanzang visited this place because of the Buddhist influences in this region during that period.
